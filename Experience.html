<button class="accordion">My first experience entering university</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The journey began when I was offered the opportunity to continue my studies at the UiTM Rembau campus with my first choice course, Information Management. To summarise, the experience of starting the journey of university study was one I will never forget. I made a lot of new friends there, and I got to know my housemates. When we have free time, I spend a lot of time with my housemates. Some memories are on Friday night, we are having a sleepover and watched a movie together. On weekends, we also rarely go home, preferring to hang out outside the campus. In addition, we walked outside the campus area at night to eat. Also, we have been to Melaka at night to have our dinner together. We occasionally have a barbecue at the home of our housemate's uncle, who lives near the UiTM campus. In the afternoon, we'll unwind by jogging and enjoying the evening breeze in the campus area. Apart from making memories with my housemates, I also spend time with my close classmates. We will sit close together in class, and we will eat together after class in the cafe and dining area. We would sometimes hang out in the cafe late at night, chatting until late. It is a wonderful memory and experience to have new friends and acquaintances.</p>

<button class="accordion">The feeling of getting a dean's award</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When i entered university, I was determined to get the dean’s award at every sem. This is because at the time when the SPM examination results are released. I did not get the results I wanted. I began to be insecured with my exam results with another friend. So when I entered university, I wanted to use this opportunity to get the excellent results. I was very scared and anxious while waiting the result to releades. I was afraid of what I expected would not work out and it would make me feel discouraged for the next semester. But when the results came out, I was very surprised I got the dean's award on that semester. I was so excited at the time and couldn't wait to show it to the people I was close to. Alhamdulillah, thanks to my efforts and the help of friends, I have already received the dean's award from my first semester until the previous semester, which is the fourth semester. I hope the fifth semester which is my last semester, I can achieve the dean's award and graduate with the ANC award that I dreamed of insyaAllah.</p>

<button class="accordion">Being a K-Pop enthusiast</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I became interested in Kpop and all things related to Korea when I was 13 years old. It all started when I was casually playing some kpop songs on YouTube because many of my friends were talking about them at the time, and I wanted to see what they were talking about. To put it shortly, I have a collection of albums from my favourite groups, which are EXO and NCT. When their new album is out, I will often buy it with my own money. I'll join a Twitter group pre-order because it'll be cheaper than buying at the store. I bought and collected their records at the time, including the ones they had previously released. On top of that, I made a lot of new virtual friends. I met some of those friends at gatherings hosted by other fans. With my friends, I frequently attend cup sleeves events at NU Sentral in Kuala Lumpur. I used to organise my own cup sleeve event with the help of other fans. It was the most rewarding experience since I was able to communicate with fans of other races, who assisted me in improvising English-language conversations with them. Another memorable moment was meeting my idols, some members of NCT Dream, at One Utama. I attended a cultural exchange between Malaysia and Korea organised by the organisers. The occasion was also attended by Korea's Prime Minister. It was a memorial of teenage memory for me because I had a youth memory that was interested in something precious at the time.</p>

<button class="accordion">Most traumatic horror moment</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The incident occurred while I was attending an SPM seminar at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). During the seminar camp's second night. I have an Islamic seminar class that I attend. After the isyak prayer time, the lesson begins at 9 a.m. In the middle of the lecture, I noticed a group of my close friends from another class panicked and reading a surah from their seats. Something weird seemed to be happening on there at the time. Then, after some time had passed, one of the friends was found lying down. Something had already possessed her. Her attitude had changed, and she began laughing continuously with laughter. It was terrifying to witness the situation. She got extremely unconscious as well as acted weirdly and creepily as the rest of the students in the halls panicked. The facilitator directed us to exit the hall and walk to the hall below. We were also asked to keep moving and avoid looking at the possessed girl. We had no choice but to leave our items on the table and make our way downstairs. I left my cell phone behind at the moment because I was so terrified of the possession changing other people's bodies. This is because I was having menstruation at the time, and I was really afraid of getting discouraged by the situation. We gathered with another seminar subject class below, and they were somewhat odd when it came to facing our fears. The teacher tried to shift our attention so that we wouldn't have to worry about what was going on. We began to sit in groups and recite surahs for as long as we needed to. However, my female friends began to cry because they were terrified and dismayed. Some even advised a friend to close the curtains in the window because he noticed someone staring at her from behind the curtains. Instead of staying in our individual dorms, we were told to sleep in the hall. I couldn't sleep at the moment because I was terrified of something happening down the hall. We had to go to the bathroom in groups as well. There were other friends in the hall who were rebellious and wanted to leave since they had heard the surah we recited. It had been the most horrific seminar experience I'd ever had. Until now, when there is a possession incident in front of me or all around me. I'll be terrified because I remember what happened right in front of my eyes. I'd start to feel discouraged and afraid. At the end, I'm hoping I don't have to go through this again.</p>

<button class="accordion">Having interested in taking photo moments</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>I enjoy capturing moments in time so that I can look back on them as memories. I'll take any shot that matches my aesthetic. I’ll keep it and if I have the time, I’ll spend my time edit the images shot on a VSCO or Adobe LightRoom applications. I also often see some image inspiration on Pinterest. There a loads of wonderful photographs that meet my aesthetic view in the picture. At last, i did love to upload my pictures on my VSCO account platform. Here are my VSCO username, @narsdyna or you can just click the button down below.
